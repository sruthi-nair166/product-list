### Overview

This project is a responsive product listing page for an e-commerce website. It features a clean layout with a search bar, category-based filtering, and sorting options to help users browse products efficiently.

Users can explore products displayed in a grid layout, with each product card showing essential details such as image, name, price, category, and rating. The interface includes a filter dropdown to narrow products by category and a sort menu to arrange products by price or rating (high to low or low to high).

The search functionality allows users to find products by name in real time. The layout is fully responsive and designed to provide a smooth browsing experience across different screen sizes.
